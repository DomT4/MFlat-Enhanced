MFlat-Enhanced
==============

*M'Flat Enhanced: Original Creations. 175+ Icons Supported across Retina & Non-Retina iDevices, including iPads. 1600+ downloads to date.*

This is my own spin on the popular M'Flat theme. I love M'Flat, but I never really felt like it was the complete package in terms of quality, consistency & support for older or larger devices. This aims to fix these issues.

Over 175 icons supported across iPhone, iPad & iPod (Retina & Non-Retina), iOS7 & iOS6, including full settings theming & support for popular tweaks like Priority Hub & Auxo 2.

**The easiest way to apply this is by**:

* Jailbreak your iDevice, Download 'Winterboard'.
* Download/Clone this repo, FTP into your iDevice, go to Library > Themes and drop the MFlatEnhanced.theme folder into there.
* Open up 'Winterboard', choose 'M'Flat Enhanced' and apply.

All of these icons are my own creations; You will not find them in any other package. All the images used for backgrounds are credited & always will be, and the license for my package is a Creative Commons license for others to build on if they so wish.
