Full Change Log:

- V0.1 - Initial Cydia Release.

- V0.2 - Vastly Improved iOS6 Support. Improved iPad support. New icons added to the package.

- V0.3 - Improved iPad Retina & Non-Retina Support. New Icons Added.

- V0.4 - Over 20 new icons added.

- V0.5 - More icons added. Tweaked some existing icons. Implemented better icon cohesion throughout the system.

- V0.6 - New icons; over the 100 mark in icons supported now. Implemented .plist support for changing the calendar font colour to be clearer. Improvements to several existing icons.

- V0.7 - Bug fix for the 1Password icon that wouldn't theme; it should do now. Added support for Ryan Petrich's iOS7.1 Calendar port.

- V0.8 - This is a BIG update for Retina iPad owners. All of your stock Apple icons, except the calendar, should now be themed. Non-Retina & iPhone owners should have had that stock theming complete in the last couple of updates. In addition to the complete stock theming, 6 new icons have been added to the package total. (Up to 107 supported now). Remember to respring after download if you already have the theme applied.

- V0.9 - Tiny update. Mostly optimisations to previously themed icons. Probably the most noticeable thing about this update is that it comes with, and it somewhat pains me to note how widely requested this was, Flappy Bird icon support.

- V1.0 - We are out of BETA, at last. 30+ new icons supported, and have taken tentative first steps towards total theming of the Settings. Massively improved iPad & iOS6 support. As always, remember to reapply the theme & respring to see all the new changes.

- V1.1 - A potential fix for the iPad calendar icon issue, a fix for the iPhoto icon issue, a plethora of iOS6 updates, extremely basic IOS5 support (that is a coincidence rather than an immediate plan to support IOS5), a fix for the Snapchat icon refusing to theme, 10+ new icons supported, several very minor iPad fixes, several existing icons tweaked for clarity, and last but not least, full stock settings theming for all iDevices. As ever reapply & respring to see all changes.

- V1.2 - A fix for the Apple Numbers icon not theming. 15 new icons supported, including multiple requested icons. Reapply & Respring to see all changes.
