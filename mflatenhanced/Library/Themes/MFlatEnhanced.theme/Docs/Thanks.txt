M’Flat Special Thanks:

Mushcube’s for the original M’Flat idea & design.

Jato_BZ (https://twitter.com/Jato_BZ) for his extensive help theming the Settings app, and considerable knowledge shared.

All my Beta testers, but particularly Justin who helped considerably with regular, detailed feedback on the iPad side of things. I couldn’t have asked for better, more patient beta testers and I appreciate everyone who aided me through that stage.
